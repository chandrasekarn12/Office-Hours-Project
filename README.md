## Problem Statement
Students in **CMSC 216** (Introduction to Computer Systems) at the University of Maryland often wait **hours** for help during office hoursâ€”especially near project deadlines.  
This project *quantitatively* models the queue and explores staffing strategies that shrink the average wait for everyone.

## Methodology

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Data Collection** | Scraped queue length & active-TA counts from *Quuly* across three busy days |
| **2. Stochastic Modeling** | Modeled student arrivals & service completions as independent Poisson processes (â‡’ exponential inter-arrival/service times) |
| **3. Parameter Estimation** | Estimated mean service time â‰ˆ **37.5 min** per TA and mean arrival interval â‰ˆ **32.8 min** |
| **4. Monte-Carlo Simulation** | Explored how varying TA counts & shift splits affects wait time and backlog clearance |

The full R notebook lives in [`FinalProject.Rmd`](./FinalProject.Rmd) and renders to [`FinalProject.html`](./FinalProject.html).

## Key Findings

| Scenario | Avg. Wait â†“ | TAs Needed |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Baseline (1 TA) | â€” | 1 |
| Steady State (average day) | **2Ã— faster** | 2 |
| No Growth (busy day) | **5Ã— faster** | 5 |
| Clear 10-student backlog â‰¤ 1 h | **8â€“12Ã— faster** | 8â€“12 |

> **Optimal staffing:** 6 TAs split **1 / 3 / 2** across morning, afternoon, and evening minimizes overflow under our assumptions.
